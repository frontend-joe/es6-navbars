        <h2>What Is ES6?</h2>
        <p>
          ES6 or ECMAScript 2015 is the 6th version of the ECMAScript
          programming language. ECMAScript is the standardization of Javascript
          which was released in 2015, and subsequently renamed as ECMAScript
          2015. ECMAScript and Javascript are both different in nature.
        </p>
        <h2>ECMAScript vs Javascript</h2>
        <p>
          ECMAScript: It is the specification defined in ECMA-262 for creating a
          general purpose scripting language.In simple terms it is a
          standardization for creating a scripting language.It was introduced by
          Ecma International, and is basically an implementation with which we
          learn how to create a scripting language. Javascript: A general
          purpose scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript
          specification.It is basically an implementation which tells us how to
          use a scripting language.
